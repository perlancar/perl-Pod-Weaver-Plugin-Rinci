        - [internal] Revert from using Require::Hook::DzilBuild to using 'local

	- [Bugfix] Fix log message which logged the temporary script name

        - Uses Require::Hook::DzilBuild. UPDATE 2017-01-20: revert to using

	- Add note about hash argument (--name=s%) being specified using
	  key=value syntax and can be specified multiple times too like

	  'hidden' & 'hidden-mod' in argument spec tags.

	- [Bugfix] Referred to the wrong variable so that example results

        - [Enhancement] Introduce x.doc.max_result_lines in example spec to
          limit number of output lines shown.

        - Bail when there is an error while running example script.

        - [Bugfix] Add -Ilib when executing script when producing output for
          examples with src_plang=bash so dev version of modules are used.

        - Recognize pod: and prog: URL schemes in links and convert them to
          proper L<...> POD links.

	  tagged 'hidden'.


0.61    2016-08-03  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Update the content of the CONFIGURATION FILE section for
	  Perinci::CmdLine::Base 1.57 (where config_filenames might be an

	  Exporter::Rinci's.


0.57    2016-03-26  Released-By: PERLANCAR

        - Do not import dist modules because this causes problems with some
          modules, e.g. modules that export 'has' (like
          Class::Build::Array::Glob) and clash with Moose which is used by the
          plugin. Except when dist module is using Exporter::Rinci as its
          exporter (which I originally added the import() for, because
          Exporter::Rinci which works by filling @EXPORT* variables during
          import()).


0.56    2016-02-26  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- [Bugfix] Didn't normalize metadata when getting metadata, so we
	  didn't get _orig_args_as & _orig_result_naked, so example
	  rendering in modules was incorrect.


0.55    2016-02-22  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- If we encounter a subcommand where its spec has been seen before

	- Support multiple config filenames (Perinci::CmdLine::Lite 1.44+).

	- More efforts to keep ordering correct (but now we also have
	  PWR:SortVersions).


0.52    2015-12-25  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- [Bugfix] invoke module's import() first, so modules using
	  Exporter::Rinci can work (because it populates @EXPORT or
	  @EXPORT_OK in import()).


0.51    2015-12-18  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- No functional changes.

	- Bump prereq version Perinci::To::POD 0.68 -> 0.70.


0.50    2015-12-17  Released-By: PERLANCAR

        - Wording for POD header for configuration for subcommand: from just

0.45    2015-09-25  Released-By: PERLANCAR

        - Observe example spec's x.doc.show_result.


0.44    2015-09-23  Released-By: PERLANCAR

        - Show example's result (if example spec does not specify result, will
          call function via Riap to get the result).


0.43    2015-09-03  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Workaround to avoid undef in dump env_name and
	  config_filename/program_name.

	  given by Perinci::Sub::To::CLIDocData 0.18.

	- Add before_section/after_section options when adding text to
	  section to place created sections appropriately.

	- Add ~/.config/ dir for FILES.

        - Add back the functionalities of adding FILES as well as ENVIRONMENT
          sections. It's better that the functionalities are added here because
          we can avoid having to dump/detect script repeatedly.

        - Use Pod::Weaver::Role::AddTextToSection.
